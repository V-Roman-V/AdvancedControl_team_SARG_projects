## Task Definition

Given the initial state $\mathbf{x}_i$ and a desired position $\mathbf{x}_d$, the goal is to design a control law $ \mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2]^T$ such that the boat will finish at the desired position with zero velocity.
The boat can finish at any angle. The thruster force can only be applied in the forward direction.


## Mathematical Model

### Boat Kinematics

Let the state vector of the boat be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x, & y, & \psi, & V_x, & V_y, & \omega \end{bmatrix}^T,
$$

where:
- $x, y$ are the position coordinates,
- $\psi$ is the yaw (heading),
- $V_x, V_y$ are the surge and sway velocities (linear velocities in the body-fixed frame),
- $\omega$ is the yaw rate.

The boat dynamic equations are in matrix form is following:

<!-- $$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &= V_x \cos(\psi) - V_y \sin(\psi), \\
\dot{y} &= V_x \sin(\psi) + V_y \cos(\psi), \\
\dot{\psi} &= \omega, \\
\dot{V}_x &= \frac{1}{m}\left(F_x(u)\right) - D_x V_x, \\
\dot{V}_y &= \frac{1}{m}\left(F_y(u)\right) - D_y V_y, \\
\dot{\omega} &= \frac{1}{I_z} \left( M(u) \right) - D_p \omega
\end{aligned}
$$ -->

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{x} \\
    \dot{y} \\
    \dot{\psi} \\
    \dot{V}_x \\
    \dot{V}_y \\
    \dot{\omega}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & \cos(\psi) & -\sin(\psi) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \sin(\psi) & \sin(\psi) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -D_x & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -D_y & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -D_p
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    \psi \\
    V_x \\
    V_y \\
    \omega
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
\frac{1}{m} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{m} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{I_z}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
F_x(u) \\
F_y(u) \\
M(u)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where:
- $m$ is the boat's mass,
- $I_z$ is the moment of inertia about the vertical axis,
- $D_x, D_y, D_\psi$ are the damping coefficients,
- $F_x, F_y$ are the forces due to the thrusters, and
- $M$ is the moment generated by the thrusters.



#### Differential Drive Boat:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_x(u) &= u_1 + u_2\\
F_y(u) &= 0 \\
M(u) &= L(u_1 - u_2)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $u_1$ and $u_2$ are the control inputs for the left and right motors, respectively.
- $L$ is the distance between the motor and the center of the boat.

#### Steerable Drive Boat:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_x(u) &= u_f \cos(u_\phi)\\
F_y(u) &= u_f \sin(u_\phi)\\
M(u) &= L \cdot u_f \sin(u_\phi)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $u_f$ is the control for the motor.
- $u_\phi$ is the control for the steering angle.
- $L$ is the distance between the motor and the center of the boat.


## Energy-based Control Design

### Lyapunov Function Candidate:
We'll use the total energy with additional potential term as our Lyapunov function:

$$
V = \frac{1}{2}m(V_x^2 + V_y^2) + \frac{1}{2}I_z\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}k_p(x_e^2 + y_e^2)
$$

Energy consist of three parts:
- Kinetic energy of the linear motion
- Kinetic energy of the rotational motion
- Potential energy (error in position)

Where:
- \( x_e = x - x_d \) and \( y_e = y - y_d \) are the position errors
- k_p is a positive constant like a gravitational constant

### Time Derivative:
\[ \dot{V} = m(V_x\dot{V}_x + V_y\dot{V}_y) + I_z\omega\dot{\omega} + k_p(x_e\dot{x}_e + y_e\dot{y}_e) \]

#### Diferential Drive Boat:
TODO: define control law
TODO: substitute the control law into the time derivative of the Lyapunov function
TODO: simplify the expression to show that \( \dot{V} \leq 0 \)

#### Steerable Drive Boat:
TODO: define control law
TODO: substitute the control law into the time derivative of the Lyapunov function
TODO: simplify the expression to show that \( \dot{V} \leq 0 \)

### Stability Proof:
1. \( V \) is positive definite (always ≥ 0, and = 0 only at desired state)
2. \( \dot{V} \) is negative semi-definite (≤ 0 for all states)
3. The system is asymptotically stable since \( \dot{V} = 0 \) only when \( V_x = V_y = \omega = 0 \), which implies \( x_e = y_e = 0 \)

### Achieving Critical Damping

For critical damping, we need to find the gains to eliminate oscillations to achive fast convergence.


## Repository Structure

### `control.py`

This file contains the `Controller` classes for **Differential** and **Steering** boats, which computes the control inputs based on the boat state, desired state.

### `boat.py`

This file contains two boat classes `DifferentialThrustBoat` and `SteerableThrustBoat` that models boat dynamics, given the current control inputs.

### `visualization.py`

This module provides functions to visualize the boat trajectory and desired position. 
The visualization has three modes: 'gif', 'realtime', 'final'. The 'gif' mode generates a GIF of the boat motion, 'realtime' shows the simulation in real-time, and 'final' displays the final trajectory after the simulation.

### `main.py`

The `main.py` file is the entry point for the simulation. It initializes the boat, sets up the controller, and runs the simulation loop. At each time step, the control inputs are computed, and the boat state is updated. The trajectory is then visualized.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```
