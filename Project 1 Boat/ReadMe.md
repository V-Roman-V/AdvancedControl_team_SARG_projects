## Overview

This project is focused on the **controlling** of a motorized boat using energy based control.

## Mathematical Model

### Boat Kinematics

Let the state vector of the boat be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x, & y, & \psi, & V_x, & V_y, & \omega \end{bmatrix}^T,
$$

where:
- $x, y$ are the position coordinates,
- $\psi$ is the yaw (heading),
- $V_x, V_y$ are the surge and sway velocities (linear velocities in the body-fixed frame),
- $\omega$ is the yaw rate.

The boat kinematic equations are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &= V_x \cos(\psi) - V_y \sin(\psi), \\
\dot{y} &= V_x \sin(\psi) + V_y \cos(\psi), \\
\dot{\psi} &= \omega.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Vessel Dynamics

Let $u$ be the control input. The dynamics is:  

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}_x &= \frac{1}{m}\left(F_x(u)\right) - D_x V_x, \\
\dot{V}_y &= \frac{1}{m}\left(F_y(u)\right) - D_y V_y, \\
\dot{\omega} &= \frac{1}{I_z} \left( M(u) \right) - D_p \omega
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $m$ is the vessel's mass,
- $I_z$ is the moment of inertia about the vertical axis,
- $D_x, D_y, D_\psi$ are the damping coefficients,
- $F_x, F_y$ are the forces due to the thrusters, and
- $M$ is the moment generated by the thrusters.


#### Differential Drive Boat:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_x(u) &= u_1 + u_2\\
F_y(u) &= 0 \\
M(u) &= L(u_1 - u_2)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $u_1$ and $u_2$ are the control inputs for the left and right motors, respectively.
- $L$ is the distance between the motor and the center of the boat.

#### Steerable Drive Boat:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_x(u) &= u_f \cos(u_\phi)\\
F_y(u) &= u_f \sin(u_\phi)\\
M(u) &= L \cdot u_f \sin(u_\phi)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
- $u_f$ is the control for the motor.
- $u_\phi$ is the control for the steering angle.
- $L$ is the distance between the motor and the center of the boat.

TODO:

### Control Objective

Let the desired state be \(\mathbf{x}_d = [x_d, y_d, \psi_d, V_{x,d}, V_{y,d}, \omega_d]^T\). The error between the actual and desired states is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{e} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_d.
\]
The control objective is to design a control law \( \mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2]^T \) such that the error dynamics are asymptotically stable.

### Lyapunov Control Design

A Lyapunov function candidate is defined as:
\[
V(\mathbf{e}) = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{e}^T\mathbf{e}.
\]
The derivative of \( V(\mathbf{e}) \) with respect to time is:
\[
\dot{V} = \mathbf{e}^T\dot{\mathbf{e}}.
\]
The control law is designed to ensure that:
\[
\dot{V} \le -\alpha \|\mathbf{e}\|^2,
\]
where \( \alpha > 0 \) is a constant.

## Repository Structure

### `control.py`

This file contains the `VesselController` class, which computes the control inputs based on the vessel's state, desired state, and the regression function \( \phi(\mathbf{x}) \). It also implements the adaptive control law for parameter estimation.

### `boat.py`

The `Boat` class models the vessel's state and dynamics. It computes the evolution of the vessel's state over time, given the current control inputs. The state variables include position, velocity, yaw, and yaw rate.

### `visualization.py`

This module provides functions to visualize the vessel's trajectory and compare it with the desired trajectory. The `visualize` function uses Matplotlib to plot the vessel's path in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

### `main.py`

The `main.py` file is the entry point for the simulation. It initializes the vessel's state, sets up the controller, and runs the simulation loop. At each time step, the control inputs are computed, and the vessel's state is updated. The trajectory is then visualized.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will simulate the vessel's motion and plot the trajectory. The vessel will try to track the desired trajectory defined in the simulation, while the controller adapts to model uncertainties.
